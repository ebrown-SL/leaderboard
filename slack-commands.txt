/slallenge
create <league>
enter <league>
challenge @X [<league>] -> league required if you are in more than one league together
challenges [@X] -> by default, my challenges (or specific user's challenges)
results [<league>] -> by default, all my leagues (or specific league)
(retract|win|lose|confirm) @X <league> | <challengeId> -> league required if you are in more than one league together OR challengeId required if you have more than one challenge together
-> for win|lose, can happen without an existing challenge, it just creates it straight away
-> then need confirm
-> could have win|confirm|lose @X @Y <league> | <challengeId> -> by default, implied that you're an actor (the X or Y), but could have a third party reporting the game
====
(challengeId = @X_@Y_<league>  so should also work with @Y_@X_<league>)
